# 🌱 FarmaBuddy – AI Powered Smart Farming Assistant  
**CRS Artificial Intelligence – Formative Assessment 2   
**Course:** Generative A.I  
**Team:** Jashith Rathod, Nishtha Shah, Naman Shreshtha  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

FarmaBuddy is a Generative AI-powered web application built using **Streamlit** and **Google Gemini 1.5 API**.

The system provides region-specific, actionable farming advice to farmers in:

- 🇮🇳 India  
- 🇬🇭 Ghana  
- 🇨🇦 Canada  

The assistant formats AI responses clearly and includes reasoning behind each recommendation to improve farmer trust and usability.

This project transforms the FA-1 storyboard into a fully functional and deployed AI application.

---

## 🎯 Intended Learning Outcomes Achieved

- ✔ Format and refine outputs generated by Gemini for clarity and real-world usability  
- ✔ Evaluate and optimize model outputs using prompt engineering  
- ✔ Deploy a working AI web application using Streamlit Cloud  
- ✔ Implement user interaction monitoring and feedback collection

## 🧠 Step 4 – Output Formatting & Reasoning

To ensure clarity and usefulness:

- Gemini outputs are structured into bullet points.
- Each recommendation includes a justification (“why” explanation).
- Technical language is simplified.
- Advice is region-aware and crop-stage specific.

### 📍 Example Prompt Tested

**Input:**  
“What to grow in Rajasthan in August?”

**Formatted Output:**

- **Pearl Millet** – Drought-resistant and thrives in arid soil.  
- **Cluster Bean** – Suitable for sandy soil with low irrigation.  
- **Green Gram** – Short crop cycle fits monsoon season.  

Each suggestion includes reasoning to build user trust.

---

## 🔎 Step 5 – Model Validation & Optimization

### 🌍 Validation Regions Tested

1. India (Rajasthan, Punjab)  
2. Ghana (Northern Region)  
3. Canada (Ontario, Alberta)  
4. Tamil Nadu (India)  
5. British Columbia (Canada)  

---

### 📋 Feedback Checklist Designed

Each AI output was evaluated using:

- ✅ Is the advice specific to the input region?
- ✅ Does it provide logical reasoning?
- ✅ Is the language simple?
- ✅ Are steps actionable?
- ✅ Is the advice safe and ethical?

---

### 🔧 Optimization Actions Taken

| Issue Found | Optimization Applied |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Generic advice | Added region + crop stage in prompt |
| Overly technical terms | Added instruction: “Use simple language” |
| Long paragraphs | Requested bullet format |
| Weak reasoning | Added instruction: “Explain why after each suggestion” |
| Over-generalization | Reduced temperature to 0.5 |

Temperature tuning improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations.
